Mood Tracker
​A simple and engaging 14-day mood tracker written in Python. This project began as a command-line script to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and has evolved to include a graphical interface.
​Project Files
​mood_tracker.py: The original command-line version of the mood tracker, written by the repository owner. It handles all core logic, including user input, mood scoring, and calculating results.
​mood_tracker_gui.py: A second version of the project that adds a graphical user interface (GUI). This file was created with assistance from Gemini, a large language model.
​A Coder's Mood
​In lines of Python, a tracker waits,
To chart the course of daily fates.
A loop begins, a fortnight's span,
To understand a user's plan.
​Each morning asks, with gentle phrase,
For feelings lived through passing days,
A simple choice, an emoji's plea,
To mark the soul's brief history.
​If ☺️ shines, the score is ten,
A happy mood, again and again.
But should a 😭 bring a tear,
A single point is marked with fear.
​The code receives, it understands,
And saves the score with patient hands,
A list of numbers, one by one,
'Til the fourteen days are done.
​Then, at the end, a total sum,
A mood report for all to come.
An average heart, a happiness score,
That shows the feeling at the core.
​From Very Happy down to a sigh,
A final note against the sky.
A simple script, a digital friend,
From start to finish, to the end.
